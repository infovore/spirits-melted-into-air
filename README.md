Spirits Melted Into Air
=======================

    Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
    As I foretold you, were all spirits and
    Are melted into air, into thin air:

_The Tempest, Act IV, Scene i_


Introduction
------------

_Spirits Melted Into Air_ is a project exploring the motion of actors on stage. Shakespeare is frequently understood - especially by those studying it - as a text first and foremost. But the RSC's work is about interpreting, performing, and presenting that text. Drama is not static: it is physical, it is energetic. The words come to life in the context of a performance. And that performance takes place across a huge stage: though it may look small from a distance, it's a large space for an actor to cover, and many great performances take in all of it.

_Spirits_ attempts to show the performance beyond the words: the work of Actors, Directors, and Choreographers. It does that in two phases: first, capturing that performance; then, illustrating and interpreting it.

Technical Notes
---------------

It's not expected that you'll be able to immediately get _Spirits_ running out
of the box; its open-source nature is mainly for illustration. However:

* `spirits_rec.pde` and `playback` are Processing sketches, designed for
  Processing 1.5. They _will not_ work in Processing 2.0 without modification.
* You'll need the following Processing libraries to run them: GSVideo, Keystone, ControlP5.

Notes on video
--------------

No sample video is included; you'll have to source that yourself. No sample
data is included; you'll have to generate that yourself. Consider this
a software release without any data - much of the data used in the original
artwork is copyright the RSC. This code is the only open-source element of the
project.
