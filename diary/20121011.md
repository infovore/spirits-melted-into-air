Today I took the recorded data and started producing output from it.

I wrote a small processing script to display a dot on the screen for every line
of data - works well so far. A bit more work turns this into a line plot - and
then, with one library and some more code, I've got an SVG plot coming out.

The rest of the day was spent ingesting this SVG into Illustrator, and then
playing with graphic design. Discoveries here: the graphic design will take
a bit of time, but I'd like it to be nice, and it's feeling a bit crowded right
now; also, it'd be nice to smooth the data out a bit.

And, I realise, I need to make sure the data is scaled to match the dimensions
of the stage in question. I know that right now it's not. That's not too hard
a problem to solve, and it's worth remembering this is an approximate
visualisation, not some kind of data science. So to speak.

I also played with generating a version for lasercutting. So far: that could
work out quite nicely. I'm going to smooth the data before I do much more
there, though.
