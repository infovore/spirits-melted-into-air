Today mainly focused on the website to explain this - wireframing it, shelling
it up with Twitter Bootstrap, working out what I'd need - and wrapping up
a first draft of the script for the movie.

There was also some finessing of the A2 poster designs, which should be going
to print soon - adding a URL, making a few things a bit clearer. No doubt
they'll change again once Comedy of Errors is done, but I like the first draft
for now.
