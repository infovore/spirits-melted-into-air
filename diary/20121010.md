Data arrived from Stratford, handed off at the door much like a spy movie. Two
videos: one of Richard III, one of Comedy of Errors. 1080i video turns out to
be VERY big - 120gb each. So we're going to have to scale that down just to get
it onto my laptop.

I initially try out using ffmpeg to spit out a batch of jpgs from the video,
displaying them in the background as a "flickbook". This turned out to be less
than optimal - lousy framerates, and I can't really load thousands of jpgs into
memory.

I try using a video player class in the background - recording over the top of
Quicktime. This works a bit better, although it's still not rapid. Still, it's
a start. And then, as an idle, throwaway test, I just try running a chunk of
video through MPEG Streamclip (to cut it down to size) and then compressing it
to the DVD preset in ffmpeg. And all of a sudden: full-framerate, 30fps video,
that I can record over. Great.
