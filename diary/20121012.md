I spent a short while today experimenting with smoothing out the data. Nothing
complex: just discarding every N points, and playing with values of N. It made
the data a bit less... hyperactive, less sensitive - and led to even better
results with Illustrator's built in "smoothing".

There are other ways to approach smoothing, too - rather than just discarding
every N points, I could do something smart about rate of change - but I think
that might be a red herring. For now, a bit less data is working nicely.
