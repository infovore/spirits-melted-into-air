Trip to Stratford with Natalia today, to meet Sarah, Ida, and lots of people at the RSC. Really great day: so many interesting people, and such a lot of enthusiasm for what we were doing. It was great to chat about people-tracking with James from Front-of-House; to see the opportunities for marketing the game - and especially to listen to Vince effusively talking about his own work and offering insight into ours.

It wasn't annoying to have to explain myself five times - if anything, being asked to explain the project again and again really brought it into focus for me. After five hours of meeting, talking, and thinking, I was done in, but head alight. A few new ideas for the project emerged - notably, the 3D fabricating part - and for now, I'm being diverse in my head before having to scale it down.

Really good day, anyhow.

Also: the project now has a name, taken from the Tempest, appropriately.
