ffmpeg -i swan.mov -r 12 -f image2 image-%05d.jpg

is how we spit out 12FPS video from a mov to a directory of JPGs.

Slow work today, but: we've got this working with video. Or rather, we've got this working with sliced JPGs. I'm going to see if I can attempt a port with a .mov file, but that at least works with a stage, 3D, and moving images, and we get data out. The next thing will be to investigate doing useful things with that data out.

Ida rang to confirm we'd got some video, hallelujah!

I've tried a port to using .movs; the good news is it just about works, but it might not be accurate enough. The bad news is the flickering gives me a headache; that feels like it's something to do with the background() call, or maybe the texture. Hmn.
