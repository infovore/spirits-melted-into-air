Today I picked up the laser-cut version of "Winter of Discontent" from Cut
Laser Cut. Heart in my mouth as I went along - and then BOOM, just gorgeous.
Very excited. Don't think I'll alter it at all - just get on with producing
a pair of them for CofE when I get a chance.

Back to the studio and watched Comedy of Errors; in the end, I think a scene
between Dromio of Ephesus and Adriana - lots of physicality, lots of mirroring,
might come out rather nice! We shall see how it goes tomorrow.

Picked out the scene with MPEG Streamclip and ffmpeg, all ready to go, and set
up the recorded to be mapped to the RST's dimensions.

Tomorrow, we should get what we need out of "Comedy", and wrap up all the
posters - maybe even order the final laser cutting. Then Thursday can be for
producing the website a bit, perhaps starting work on some filming.
