Good progress today. Fixed a few little things that were niggling me - most
notably, the Quad (the texture we record from) now begins at the proportions of
the stage in question, so that when we scale it down, it more accurately
reflects what was going on.

It's also higher resolution - about 2000 units wide. I re-recorded Richard III
at that higher resolution, and started working on new output formats.

The poster is now looking much more beautiful; it's also much bigger. I'm going
to make it A2, I think.

I also used some templates from Cut Laser Cut to make the first draft of the
Richard III lasercut wood; that's looking pretty nice. Hopefully they'll be
able to advise me on price/time for those tomorrow.

And otherwise, I tidied up a lot of the git repo, it was getting cluttered.
Tomorrow I'll talk to Ida about progress, and see if I can't make some progress
on Comedy of Errors.
