A short day - the first of working for myself full time - but made a bunch of progress.

Today, I moved from the pure 2D, top-down view of the "stage" area to a 3D version - or rather, a projection-mapped version, using the Keystone library (http://keystonep5.sourceforge.net/). I was worried this was going to take a long while; in fact, with some judicious copy/paste and some careful thinking, it took around an hour.

I set up a temporary backdrop - where the video will eventually go - using a stockphoto of the Swan, and practiced some runs with it. Worked very well! Really exciting to see something taking shape.

So, the last major thing to do is to move from a stock image in the background to a video. I think that's today's task, and I think I'm going to do it using not a video player, but by slicing video into stills at the command-line, and then turning the backdrop into a flickbook. That feels like a day or two, but things seem to be going well.

This can all be done independently of video arriving from the RSC, so for now, I'm going to chug on.

Hopefully the recorder will be finished in a day or two, and I can start investigating output formats.
