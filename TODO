  maybe string on Recording to log current filename
how do we ignore keypresses when textfield has focus?
how do we pause playback?

annotations:
  - if in step mode
  - at this particular point, hit a button
  - dialogue box, maybe, "string to annotate with"|durationInFrames
  - annotations = [["oh that this too too solid flesh", 34,50]]
    - here's a string, display it from frame 34 for 50 frames
    - ie, every frame, find the first annotation where startFrame <= now and now < (startFrame + duration), show the annotation at the... point it begins? cursor?
  - when we render this out, though, maybe we just add the annotation to all relevant frames...
  - this is a desk problem. i think we need to do tracing and skew first.

video: 
  - explore how video playback works
  - see if we can layer it in the background
  - alternatively, slice a video into frames, choose which video to use from a folder, and off we go...

proj-mapping
  - can we set up a projmap on top of a video, that's semitransparent?

recording within proj-mapping
  - can we basically translate MouseRecord into a GL texture? There are demos of this, I know.


GET DIMENSIONS OF STAGE
  - as well as unpicking to a rectangle, we need to scale it right...
